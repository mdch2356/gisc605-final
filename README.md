# GISC 605 Final! 

This final is due Sunday, December 17, 2023 at 5pm!

Thank you Alex for teaching this course! I love that you let us joke around when allowed and was able to be very descriptive in your teachings!
I hope that we get to have you as a professor soon again as I do enjoy the "streamer" concept of all the classes!
Thank you once again, have some very happy, jolly holidays and a happy new year!!

Good luck to me!!
